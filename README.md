Successfully completed a comprehensive project in Data Modeling and Database Systems. The project involved designing and populating a relational database using MySQL Workbench. 

Key Tasks and Achievements
- Database Design and Population:
Developed a relational database to manage information related to patients, surgeries, medications, and staff.
Populated the database with a substantial amount of realistic data to facilitate the execution of complex queries.
- SQL Scripting:
Created SQL scripts using MySQL Workbench to ensure seamless execution without errors.
Formatted SQL queries for enhanced readability and included comments for clarity.
- Query Execution and Result Analysis:
Executed various SQL queries to extract meaningful information from the database.
Provided evidence of the results for each query, showcasing the practical application of database concepts.
- Advanced Database Operations:
Implemented a view to display essential patient and surgery information.
Created a 'MedInfo' table and implemented triggers to manage data loading, updating, and deletion seamlessly.
Developed a stored procedure to retrieve the number of medications taken by a patient, with the output stored in a session variable.
Designed a function to calculate the remaining days for the expiration of medications, displaying relevant information for medicines with less than a month (30 days) until expiry.
- XML Data Integration:
Stored data related to staff and patients in two XML files.
Utilized SQL queries to load XML data into the respective tables within the database.

The project showcases my practical skills in database management and ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.Successfully completed a comprehensive project in Data Modeling and Database Systems.
